The recording takes place in a busy restaurant with steady background chatter. A woman’s voice is audible but hard to understand, likely because of the surrounding noise. Some metal clinks, probably from cutlery, are heard very close to the microphone. Two short, light sounds suggest toothpicks dropping nearby. The room has some echo, but it’s not overwhelming, maybe due to a mix of hard and soft surfaces. Overall, the sound feels cluttered, typical of a crowded indoor space.
