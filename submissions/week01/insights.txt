Insights from "Die Physik der Musikinstrumente" by Yves Kemp:

1. We hear pitch changes as ratios, not simple frequency steps. 
   A doubling in frequency sounds like a consistent jump — 
   this is why octaves feel evenly spaced.

2. How an instrument is played affects how it sounds. 
   Plucking, hitting, or bowing a string all lead to 
   different vibration patterns and energy loss.

3. Materials can influence the sound, but not always equally. 
   In violins and organ pipes, the material and shape matter a lot. 
   In flutes, the builder’s design often has a bigger impact.


Insights from "The Human Voice in Speech and Singing":

1. Breathing in speech and singing is actively controlled. 
   Muscles constantly adjust to keep pressure stable, 
   even as lung volume changes. Singers use much higher 
   lung volumes and recoil forces than speakers.

2. The pitch and tone of the voice are shaped by both 
   the vibrating vocal folds and how the vocal tract 
   filters the sound. Formants, natural resonances in 
   the vocal tract, define the vowel sounds we hear.

3. Singing demands much tighter control of pressure 
   and pitch than speaking. For example, to sing 
   consistently in tune, singers must adjust pressure 
   and vocal fold tension in precise ways that go beyond 
   what normal speech requires.
