The steady, mid-range energy around 2 kHz now reflects the speaker’s voice articulating Frost’s poem over the 35 s span. 
The broad bandwidth (~3,4 kHz) combines three layers: low-frequency engine rumble (the Triumph T120), mid-range vocal harmonics, and higher-frequency piano overtones. 
The continuous noise floor and high RMS come largely from the motorcycle’s engine, which saturates the lower spectrum and keeps energy elevated even during pauses in speech. 
The zero-crossing rate near 0,5 confirms that this engine noise and room ambience produce a broadband, noise-like background rather than discrete tonal lines. 
Intermittent spikes in the spectrogram that reach into the high frequencies correspond to Chopin’s Raindrop melody—its piano key strikes produce vertical “comb” patterns atop the hum. 
Speech segments appear as transient boosts in the 300 Hz–1 kHz band with clear formant structure, riding on the engine’s roar. 
A faint 50 Hz harmonic series betrays electrical hum or alternator noise, distinct from the motorcycle’s mechanical vibration. 
The full-scale waveform peaks occur when speech, piano accents and engine revs briefly combine—these are your richest, most energetic moments. 
Together, the low-frequency rumble, mid-range vocal formants, and high-frequency piano transients form a unique tri-layered fingerprint you can exploit to segment engine, voice, and music automatically.
